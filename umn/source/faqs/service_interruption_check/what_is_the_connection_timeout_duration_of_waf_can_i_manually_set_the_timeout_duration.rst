What Is the Connection Timeout Duration of WAF? Can I Manually Set the Timeout Duration?
========================================================================================

-  The default timeout duration for connections between a browser and WAF is 120 seconds, which cannot be manually set.

-  The default timeout duration for connections between WAF and your origin server is 60 seconds. You can customize a timeout duration.

   On the **Basic Information** page, enable **Timeout Settings** and click |image1|. Then, specify **WAF-to-Server connection timeout (s)**, **Read timeout (s)**, and **Write timeout (s)** and click |image2| to save settings.
