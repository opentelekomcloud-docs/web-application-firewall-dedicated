What Can I Do If Files Cannot Be Uploaded After a Website Is Connected to WAF?
==============================================================================

After your website is connected to WAF, the size of the file each time you can upload to the website is limited as follows:

-  Cloud mode - CNAME access: 1 GB
-  Cloud mode - load balancer access or dedicated mode: 10 GB

To upload a file larger than what is allowed, upload the file through any of the following:

-  IP address
-  Separate web server that is not protected by WAF
-  FTP server
