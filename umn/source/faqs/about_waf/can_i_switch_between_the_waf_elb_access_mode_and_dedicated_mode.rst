Can I Switch Between the WAF ELB Access Mode and Dedicated Mode?
================================================================

Direct switchover is not supported, but you can complete required configurations then use the WAF mode you want. When adding a domain name or IP address to WAF, you can select ELB access mode or dedicated mode to meet different needs. Once you select a WAF mode and connect the domain name to WAF, the WAF mode cannot be changed directly.
