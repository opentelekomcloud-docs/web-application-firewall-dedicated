Does WAF Support Custom Authorization Policies?
===============================================

WAF supports custom authorization policies. With IAM, you can:

-  Create IAM users for employees based on the organizational structure of your enterprise. Each IAM user has their own security credentials, providing access to WAF resources.
-  Grant only the permissions required for users to perform a task.
-  Entrust an account or cloud service to perform professional and efficient O&M on your WAF resources.
