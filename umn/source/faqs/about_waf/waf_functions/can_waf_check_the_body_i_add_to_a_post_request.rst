Can WAF Check the Body I Add to a POST Request?
===============================================

The built-in detection of WAF checks POST data, and web shells are the files submitted in POST requests. WAF checks all data, such as forms and JSON files in POST requests based on the default protection policies.

You can configure a precise protection rule to check the body added to POST requests.
