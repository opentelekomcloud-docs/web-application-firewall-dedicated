Can WAF Block Spam and Malicious User Registrations?
====================================================

WAF cannot block business-related attacks, such as spam and malicious user registrations. To prevent these attacks, configure the registration verification mechanism on your website.

WAF is designed to keep web applications stable and secure. It examines all HTTP and HTTPS requests to detect for and block suspicious network attacks, such as Structure Query Language (SQL) injections, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, web shell upload, command or code injections, file inclusion, unauthorized sensitive file access, third-party vulnerability exploits, Challenge Collapsar (CC) attacks, malicious crawlers, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
