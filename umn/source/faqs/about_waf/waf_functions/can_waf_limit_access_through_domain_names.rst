Can WAF Limit Access Through Domain Names?
==========================================

No. WAF supports the blacklist and whitelist rules to block, log only, or permit access requests from specified IP addresses or IP address segments.

You can configure blacklist and whitelist rules to block, log only, or permit access requests from the IP addresses or IP address segments corresponding to the domain names.
