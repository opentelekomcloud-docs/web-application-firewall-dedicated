Why Does the Vulnerability Scanning Tool Report Disabled Non-standard Ports for My WAF-Protected Website?
=========================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

When a third-party vulnerability scanning tool scans the website whose domain name has been connected to WAF, the scan result shows that some standard ports (for example, 443) and non-standard ports (for example, 8000 and 8443) are vulnerable.

Possible Cause
--------------

WAF uses the same non-standard port engine for all WAF users. So, if a third-party vulnerability scanning tool performs a scan for your website, the enabled non-standard ports in WAF are reported. This means such port vulnerabilities in scan results do not affect your origin server security. WAF will safeguard your website after you point origin server IP address to WAF engine IP address through the CNAME record.

Handling Suggestions
--------------------

No action is required.
