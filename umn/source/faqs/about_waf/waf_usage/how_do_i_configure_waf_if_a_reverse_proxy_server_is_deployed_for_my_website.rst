How Do I Configure WAF If a Reverse Proxy Server Is Deployed for My Website?
============================================================================

In this case, the reverse proxy server will not be affected after the website is connected to WAF. WAF works as a reverse proxy between the client and your website server. The real IP addresses of your website server are hidden from the visitors, and only the IP addresses of WAF are visible to them.
