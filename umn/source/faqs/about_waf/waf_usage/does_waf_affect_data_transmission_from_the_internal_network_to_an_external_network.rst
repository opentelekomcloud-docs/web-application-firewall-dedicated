Does WAF Affect Data Transmission from the Internal Network to an External Network?
===================================================================================

No. After a website is connected to WAF, all website access requests are forwarded to WAF first. WAF detects and filters out malicious attack traffic, and returns normal traffic to the origin server to keep your origin server is secure, stable, and available.
