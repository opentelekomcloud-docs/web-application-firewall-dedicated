Why Do Cookies Contain the **HWWAFSESID** or **HWWAFSESTIME** field?
====================================================================

After a domain name or IP address is connected to WAF, WAF inserts fields such as **HWWAFSESID** and **HWWAFSESTIME** into the cookie of customer requests. These fields are used for WAF statistics and security features and do not affect user services.
