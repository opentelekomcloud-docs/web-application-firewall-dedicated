What Do I Do If the Protocol Is Not Supported and the Client and Server Do Not Support Common SSL Protocol Versions or Cipher Suites?
=====================================================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

After a domain name is connected to WAF, the website cannot be accessed. A message is displayed, indicating that the protocol is not supported. The client and server do not support common SSL protocol versions or cipher suites.

Solution
--------

Select the default cipher suite for **Cipher Suite** in the **TLS Configuration** dialog box. For details, see :ref:`Configuring PCI DSS/3DS Compliance Check and TLS <waf_01_0169>`.
