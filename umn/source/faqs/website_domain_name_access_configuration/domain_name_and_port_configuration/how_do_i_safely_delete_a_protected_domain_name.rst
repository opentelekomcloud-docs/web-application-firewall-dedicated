How Do I Safely Delete a Protected Domain Name?
===============================================

To delete a website from WAF, see :ref:`Removing a Protected Website from WAF <waf_01_0005>`. Before you start, get yourself familiar with the following precautions:

-  Before removing a website from WAF, go to your DNS provider and resolve your domain name to the IP address of the origin server, or the traffic to your domain name cannot be routed to the origin server.
-  It takes a while to remove a website from WAF, but once this action is started, it cannot be cancelled. Exercise caution when removing a website from WAF.
