What Can I Do If One of Ports on an Origin Server Does Not Require WAF Protection?
==================================================================================

WAF protects your web application through its domain name and the corresponding service port. When you add a domain name to WAF, you specify the domain name and the port to be protected. After the website is connected to WAF, traffic will not be forwarded to WAF through other ports.
