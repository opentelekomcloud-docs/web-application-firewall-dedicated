Can WAF Protect Multiple Domain Names That Point to the Same Origin Server?
===========================================================================

Yes. If there are multiple domain names pointing to the same origin server, you can connect these domain names to WAF for protection.

WAF protects domain names or IP addresses. If multiple domain names use the same EIP to provide services, all these domain names must be connected to WAF.
