Why Am I Seeing the "Someone else has already added this domain name. Please confirm that the domain name belongs to you" Error Message?
========================================================================================================================================

Background
----------

Someone else has already added this domain name. You need to confirm that the domain name belongs to you. If the domain name belongs to you, contact technical support.

Causes
------

Your domain name might have been added to WAF under another account. A domain name can only be added to WAF once.

Solution
--------

If you want to add it to WAF under the current account, delete it from another account first.
