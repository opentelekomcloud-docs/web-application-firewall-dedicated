Is There Any Impact on Website Loading Speed If Other Crawler Check in Anti-Crawler Is Enabled?
===============================================================================================

If you have enabled **Other** when you configure **Feature Library** of anti-crawler protection, WAF detects crawlers for various purposes, such as website monitoring, access proxy, and web page analysis. Enabling this option does not affect web page visits or the web page browsing speed.

For details, see :ref:`Configuring Anti-Crawler Rules <waf_01_0015>`.
