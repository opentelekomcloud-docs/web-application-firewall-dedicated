Can a Precise Protection Rule Take Effect in a Specified Period?
================================================================

WAF does not allow precise protection access rules to take effect in a specified period.

You can set precise protection rules to filter access requests based on a combination of common HTTP fields (such as IP address, path, referer, user agent, and params) to allow or block the requests that match the conditions.
