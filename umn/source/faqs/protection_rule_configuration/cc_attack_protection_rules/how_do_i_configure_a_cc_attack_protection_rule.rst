How Do I Configure a CC Attack Protection Rule?
===============================================

When a service interface is under an HTTP flood attack, you can set a CC attack protection rule on the WAF console to relieve service pressure.

WAF provides the following settings for a CC attack protection rule:

-  Number of requests allowed from a web visitor in a specified period
-  Identification of web visitors based on the IP address, cookie, or referer field.
-  Action when the maximum limit is reached, such as **Block** or **Verification code**

For details, see :ref:`Configuring a CC Attack Protection Rule <waf_01_1209>`.
