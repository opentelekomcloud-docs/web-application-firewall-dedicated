Applying for a Cloud WAF Instance
=================================

To use WAF load balancer access mode, you need to apply for a cloud WAF instance. Pay-per-use billing (postpayment) is supported for WAF cloud instances.

.. note::

   To apply for pay-per-use cloud instances, contact technical support first.

Applying for a Pay-per-Use Cloud WAF Instance
---------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner of the management console and select a region or project.

#. Click |image2| in the upper left corner and choose **Web Application Firewall (Dedicated)** under **Security**.

#. In the upper right corner, click **Create WAF**.

#. (Optional): Select an enterprise project from the **Enterprise Project** drop-down list.

   This option is only available if you are logged in using an enterprise account, or if you have enabled enterprise projects. You can use enterprise projects to more efficiently manage cloud resources and project members.

   .. note::

      **default**: indicates the default enterprise project. Resources that are not allocated to any enterprise projects under your account are listed in the default enterprise project.

6. On the **Apply for Web Application Firewall** page, set **WAF Mode** to **Cloud Mode** and **Billing Mode** to **Pay-per-use**.
7. In the lower right corner of the page, click **Next**.
8. Click **Back to Website Settings** and add domain names you want to protect on the **Website Settings** page.

   .. note::

      If you want to disable WAF, choose **Instance Management** > **Product Details**, and click **Disable Pay-Per-Use Billing** next to **Cloud Mode**.
