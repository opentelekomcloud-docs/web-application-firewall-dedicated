Connection Process (Dedicated Mode)
===================================

To let your dedicated WAF instance protect your website, the domain name of the website must be connected to the WAF instance so that the website incoming traffic can go to WAF first.

Constraints
-----------

Dedicated WAF instances can only protect web applications and websites that are accessible through domain names or IP addresses.

Processes of Connecting a Website to WAF
----------------------------------------

After purchasing a dedicated WAF instance, complete the required configurations by following the process shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <waf_01_0326__fig3118103718294>`.

Fixing Inaccessible Websites
----------------------------

If a domain name fails to be connected to WAF, its access status is **Inaccessible**. To fix this issue, see :ref:`Why Is My Domain Name or IP Address Inaccessible? <waf_01_0278>`
